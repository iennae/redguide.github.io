#### Basically

# We can't rely on a single maintainer

Maybe you already tried to use some community cookbooks and asked some questions about it, submited issues or even tried to sumbit a pull-request on it.

Maybe this time the maintainer was too busy, didn't have time to reply or review your work, maybe he didn't liked the way you're bringing changes or your revolutionnary coding style ... And somes simply want to keep the whole control of their pseudo-collaborative work.

And finally, maybe yet another maintainer just disapeared in the internet-blackhole and left all his work on a frozen state, leading us to manage a "branching-hell" in our dependencies ...

#### *We just won't let this happen anymore ...*

#### **We need to keep cookbooks alive and target fast reviewing and fast merging !**
